# rust-in-unix
UNIX tools write in Rust lang

**Credits to this repo's starter code, ideas and designs are from
Stanford University CS110L (Safety in Systems Programming)**

According the reference above, I implement and modify those projects, the target is
to implement memory efficient, robust and safe system tools and learn the
safety programming semantics from the design of language Rust. eg the rust-wc 
runtime efficiency is approximately the same as the one from coreutils (wc implemented in C)
and has less (or same) heap/stack usage on large files.
